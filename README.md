# Mapping__Earthquakes

## Overview
An earthquake map was created that allows users to view different maps with earthquake overlay information. Earthquakes that occurred within the past 7 days are displayed on the map.  Earthquake data is obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey website: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/.

## Results
If the user's mouse hovers over the Layer Control icon on the top right corner of the map, this icon will display three map options: streets, satellite, and light. Each option is a base layer map with different world map views as shown below.

The Layer Control icon also displays three overlay options: tectonic plates, earthquakes, and major earthquakes.  Users can choose to view each option separately or in combination of each other as seen below.  A legend of the earthquake magnitude is shown on the bottom right corner of the map.
